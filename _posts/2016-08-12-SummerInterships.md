I'm Bledea Bogdan and together with Patricia Atieyeh, both second year students at Polytechnic University of Timisoara, we built a feedback box app for Haufe-Lexware.

Today is the last day spent @Haufe. And I must admit, this summer internship was simply awesome. My work colleagues were so friendly, they helped me when I was in trouble. And I didn't thought it's so fun to go to work.

Below, is a screenshot of the application we built during this intership, built with the Meteor framework. Meteor is a brand new framework, both front-end and back-end, which makes Meteor a great framework.

This application is for internal company use and it takes a feedback from a user, post it on the site, and sort the feedbacks by the number of votes. Users can  delete only their feedbacks, and the feedback can be modified only if there is no reply or vote.

The development process was a little bit tricky for us, and, furthermore, it was the first time we used Meteor to develop web apps. But, in the end, we proved that nothing is impossible, and if you truly want, you can learn new things anytime.

As you can see, this feedback box app has an user login&registration form, but, we restricted the account creation to the company email domain, haufe-lexware.com. After the user logs in, he can post and reply to the other feedbacks.

And when I say it was tricky, I mean, the support on the internet for docker and meteor was so poor. I've had a lot of bugs, the meteor pack for docker it wasn't at least official, and the problems we encountered, was already posted on the internet, with a lot of troubleshooting, but, nothing for our case.

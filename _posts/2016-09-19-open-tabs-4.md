Here is the latest from [Open Tabs](http://dev.haufe.com/meta/category/opinion/) - my weekly column with links and commentary on my browser tabs.

The recently published paper on [The Hidden Dividends of Microservices](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2956643) caught my attention. It inspired me to open an issue against our tech strategy to incorporate some of its conclusions. And it is only fitting that [The Five Principles of Monitoring Microservices](http://thenewstack.io/five-principles-monitoring-microservices/) is open right next to it.

You might have seen our [Haufe API Styleguide](https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/api-style-guide/blob/master/readme.md). We were honored to be included in the new [API Stylebook](http://apistylebook.com/design/guidelines/) which was published last week. I still want to read up on [The New API Design And Deployment Solution Materia](http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/12/the-new-api-design-and-deployment-solution-materia-is-pretty-slick/) and the [Restful API Versioning Insights](https://dzone.com/articles/restful-api-versioning-insights-1)

Last weeks post talked about me playing with [Rancher](http://rancher.com) as container management solution. After finishing my private setup on Digital Ocean I am now replicating part of it on AWS. My goal here is a complete  CI/CD environment including [Building docker images with Jenkins](http://blog.nimbleci.com/2016/08/31/how-to-build-docker-images-automatically-with-jenkins-pipeline/) and a private [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/). In order to make the latter accessible from beyond 'localhost' I need to set it up with TLS. While the registry appears to support [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/) out of the box, I nevertheless started researching for projects providing a containerized and automated SSL termination proxy: [Dead-simple HTTPS Set up with Docker and Let's Encrypt](http://steveltn.me/2015/12/18/nginx-acme/) pointing to <https://github.com/steveltn/https-portal> and [Docker Registry 2.0 proxy with SSL and authentication](https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/docker-registry-proxy)

On a somewhat related note - the following initiative at the intersection of Container and DevOps caught my eye: [Label Schema: A New Standard Approach to Container Metadata](http://thenewstack.io/label-schema-launches-provide-standard-approach-container-metadata/) pointing to [Label Schema Specification DRAFT (RC1)](http://label-schema.org/rc1/).

In this week's IoT corner we have [Build your own robotic arm out of cardboard](https://blog.arduino.cc/2016/09/14/build-your-own-robotic-arm-out-of-cardboard/) and [Add Motion to Your Project](http://thenewstack.io/off-shelf-hacker-add-motion-project/).

And I finally came across someone who seems to be as passionate about 'Offline-first' in mobile apps as I am - Check out his post at [Build More Reliable Web Apps with Offline-First Principles](http://thenewstack.io/build-better-customer-experience-applications-using-offline-first-principles/).

Node.js is hardly emerging technology anymore but it is sometimes worth remembering how it all began with [Ryan Dahl: Original Node.js presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztspvPYybIY). 

[Build more and Manage less With the Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com) on the other hand is cutting edge and definitely worth keeping an eye on. A bit more meta yet equally important is [The need for algorithmic accountability](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/08/the-need-for-algorithmic-accountability/) for the software industry in general.

Two more links on cultural topics. I definitely recommend checking out the
[Open Innovation Toolkit by Mozilla](https://toolkit.mozilla.org/methods/) and [How WD-40 Created a Learning-Obsessed Company Culture](https://hbr.org/2016/09/how-wd-40-created-a-learning-obsessed-company-culture),

This should cover it for this week. Plenty to read, think and catch up on. See you again next week.

Here is the latest from [Open Tabs](http://dev.haufe.com/meta/category/opinion/) - my weekly column with links and commentary on my browser tabs.

One week overdue and from the road, this weeks edition will have less commentary than usual. 

#### Innovation
I presented an overview over [Corporate Innovation](http://www.slideshare.net/HolgerReinhardt/blue-ocean-corporate-innovation) methodology at the BWCon Blue Ocean Meetup. Preparing for my presentation I (re)discovered a very good article from Steve Blank on [Why Internal Ventures are Different from External Startups](https://steveblank.com/2014/03/26/why-internal-ventures-are-different-from-external-startups/)

#### Emerging Technology
Serverless is all the rage as cloud vendors like AWS try to prevent Docker from commoditizing their platforms. Check out [Serverless Computing & Machine Learning](https://blog.alexcasalboni.com/serverless-computing-machine-learning-baf52b89e1b0#.68s3z3gpb) if that is of interest to you. And somewhat related: [With one click you'll have a sandboxed JavaScript environment where you can instantly switch node versions, use every npm module without having to wait to install it, and even visualize your results.](https://runkit.com/home)

I keep an close watch on blockchains since I truely believe in their disruptive potential. So I took note that [Microsoft delivered version 1 of 'Bletchley' Azure blockchain as a service middleware](http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-delivers-version-1-of-bletchley-azure-blockchain-as-a-service-middleware/). 

#### Development
You have kids (like me) and like gaming (like me)? How about [Teaching Unity to non-programmers](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2016/09/20/teaching-unity-to-non-programmers-playground-project/). And yes, not strictly development, but you got to admit that the [RPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) is a great way to get 'code where code has never gone before': [Turn Your Raspberry Pi into Out-of-band Monitoring Device using Docker](http://collabnix.com/archives/1885) and [Build your PiZero Swarm with OTG networking](http://blog.alexellis.io/pizero-otg-swarm/?).

#### Frontend
Check out [How Twitter deploys its webpage widgets](https://blog.twitter.com/2016/how-twitter-deploys-its-widgets-javascript).

#### Product & Marketing
If you are not content building products for the customers you already have, check out [The Power of Designing Products for Customers You Don’t Have Yet](https://hbr.org/2016/08/the-power-of-designing-products-for-customers-you-dont-have-yet). And yes - [The Presentation of Your Value Proposition Matters ](http://conversionxl.com/research-study/value-proposition-study/)

#### Data
How about [Five Ways To Create Engaging Data-Driven Stories](http://buzzsumo.com/blog/how-to-write-data-driven-stories-5-core-narratives/)? And if you are like me constantly being amazed what people do with [Github](http://github.com), check out [How We Turned Our GitHub README Model Into a Microservice](http://blog.algorithmia.com/how-we-hosted-our-model-as-a-microservice/).

#### Culture
Yes, [How much communication is too much?](https://blog.intercom.com/qa-how-much-communication-is-too-much/)  is primarily concerned about marketing, but I am looking for patterns on how to fine tune my own communication to my team and the company at large. And talking of patterns: [A personal view on the 800+ results of a tech due diligence survey to early stage startups](https://medium.com/point-nine-news/12-observations-from-a-tech-due-diligence-survey-8fe32f650b50#.x7cq2fuof).

#### API
'Thank you for the fish' - I am looking forward reading the [Hitchhiker’s Guide to Twilio Programmable Voice](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2016/09/hitchhikers-guide-to-twilio-programmable-voice.html) as well as [GraphQL Subscriptions in Apollo Client - Experimental web socket system for near-realtime updates](https://medium.com/apollo-stack/graphql-subscriptions-in-apollo-client-9a2457f015fb#.tsqinhn4i).

Over in the API developer ecosystem corner we find a good writeup on how [Virtual Assistants Harness Third Party Developer Power](http://nordicapis.com/virtual-assistants-harness-third-party-developer-power/).

The folks at [NordicAPIs](http://nordicapis.com) keep publishing amazing content, like how to [Decouple User Identity from API Design to Build Scalable Microservices](http://nordicapis.com/decouple-user-identity-from-api-design-to-build-scalable-microservices/).

And the [@apievangelist](https://twitter.com/apievangelist) scores two tabs this week: [My Forkable Minimum API Portal Definition](http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/19/my-forkable-minimum-api-portal-definition/) and [Providing YAML driven XML, JSON, and Atom using Jekyll And Github](http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/19/providing-yaml-driven-xml-json-and-atom-using-jekyll-and-github/)

Last but not least - an article on [A Twilio Process To Emulate Within Your Own API Operations](http://apievangelist.com/2016/09/19/a-twilio-process-to-emulate-within-your-own-api-operations/)

This should cover it for this week. Plenty to read, think and catch up on. See you again next week.

Today I’d like to introduce our first article on our freshly updated Haufe Group Work Blog.

Why the claim “We are UX”? 
There is a great quote from two experts, kind of gurus in this field you may know, who said that “User Experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user‘s interaction with the company, its services and its products. “ 

I believe in that! 

We all have to work together, work towards one goal, to be everyone a part of UX. Let me explain what that means in detail:

Venn and UX
-	For example business must have a vision and a clear direction. We can‘t expect that all parts work together successfully if they don’t have a clear vision.  
-	Technology must have good software architecture. This is the base for everything else.
-	The user doesn’t like or even gets really annoyed about bugs in their system but the user loves performance. 
-	The design and interaction must make sense for the customers. The designer has the job to create a good interaction for their customers. 
-	We have to create a design for the user not a design for the designer. 
-	The designer cannot only think about the small picture but it is vital they must view the big picture. 

### End to End
To create not only a single experience but a unforgettable and coherent brand experience we have to consider (keep in mind) all touchpoints for the customers if it is print, digital or something else, its respective context in time and space and the user’s emotions.

It’s important to note, that a bad business strategy can’t be saved by technology or design, that poor technological realization can’t be saved by design or a good business strategy, and that poor design can screw it up all. So let’s work on getting the best out of every discipline.

## What is a good UX model for bigger companies?

There are a lot of good UX examples, first of all Apple (just think of the groundbreaking impact of the iPhone in the industry and our lives), Google (from search engine to selfdriving cars?), Uber and many other brands which changed our lives forever. To show you that not only we are UX but that UX is everywhere and anytime, today I want to present you a different example of UX.  
So, ladies and gentlemen, to keep you interested, I have a little UX mystery for you to solve. Here are some clues and whoever solves the mystery wins a special prize. 
When you think you know the answer, please raise your hand and I will point to you. Let‘s begin!

Well done to the music specialist! Please come and collect the prize – a round of applause please. 

### It’s UX because it’s …
Now you may ask: Why is this a good example for UX? Let me explain:
According to the Rolling Stone magazine in 2013 they said that this record is the most important record in the World! From 1967 until 1971 it was the most selling album of the World. To this day it is ranked 59 of the World.

The success of this record is the sum of a lot of details and aspects we can directly connect to what we talk about and work on today as UX.
The creation of this record was a journey in itself. Before this record was released, the Beatles decided to never go back on stage. They had time for a holiday! One went to India to learn how to play the sitar, one went to Italy and Paul and John had time to speak and hear other musicians, what we now call Benchmarking, and listened to customer feedback (User research). We call this Needfinding as a part of User Centered Design. 
When they finished their holidays, they all came back together and talked about their experiences (Notice: Thinking products as a journey and experience). They realized they found something special and something new was in the air! So they defined clear goals for their new record. What they really defined is what we call a Productvision: 

1.	First of all the sound must be something new. It‘s Disruptive. 

2.	The record must be easy listening for the fans. And everybody knows: It‘s complicated to keep things easy. 

3.	A famous quote form Paul McCartney is that “The Beatles wanted to be the leaders of the Generation”. This is not only influencing the music and sound they created but also having an impact on everyone by spreading the message of peace and love during war and conflict. 

4.	They are inspired by the album of the Beach Boys, which was a great album and had an incredible impact in the music world. The Beatles wanted to compete with this record and create something bigger and better! 

During the Production of the record, they had a lot of more disruptive ideas. (-> ah, it’s agile):

-	They want to tell a story (->Storytelling), so they made the first concept-record in the world. 

-	The lyrics were so important to the Beatles that they wanted every fan to be able to read them. Nobody has done this before. 

-	So they wanted to make a record that was much more complex in its production. (Try out new instruments, new technologies of mixing, and they decided to use a complete orchestra). 

-	Packaging: They decided to make a double cover for their record, it was new.

-	The dress code for the Beatles before selling Sgt Pepper was a jacket and a tie, very well dressed! Now you can see that they created a new look. Full of colour and happiness. 

-	They thought about the image on the cover. Before, no musician was really interested in that. But the Beatles thought that it was as important for marketing. So they chose an artist to turn the cover into an artwork itself.

-	What we‘ve seen is that the Beatles looked at, the music, lyrics, cover design and their image. These are all touchpoints for the customer. 

-	Material: They wanted a coloured vinyl instead of the usual black one. But this idea wasn’t realized, because Technology said that it wasn't possible to do and the Business said, that the user only wants record with a black vinyl. (Which was a doubtful assumption).

They carried out what we today call User Testing as they provided small Radio Station with unpublished songs, to get an objective feedback. And the positive feedback was so strong, they even felt urged to publish their record before the planned release.

They didn’t know it then, but they made a classical Design-Thinking Process.


## At the End.
So let us work on the same company’s vision.

They drove technicians crazy by trying out things never tried out before, applying their inspirational creativity to all departments participating in the production. And the result is something extraordinary.

The Beatles have shown us that by creating a team where everyone works to the same vision extraordinary things can happen. It’s about all departments working together on one vision. 

I hope that you now understand, why Sgt. Pepper is good example for good UX.
A perfect product is great one when the whole experience is extraordinary… evokes emotion, like surprise and unexpected things.
